# Fintech User Behavior Analysis

## Introduction

In the rapidly evolving world of fintech, understanding user behaviour is paramount. This project dives deep into a dataset sourced from Kaggle to obtain insights into fintech user interactions, preferences, and tendencies. By analyzing various user metrics and behaviours, we aim to predict user churn and derive strategies to enhance user retention.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to:
- Understand distinct patterns in fintech user behaviour.
- Predict which users are likely to churn.
- Provide actionable insights for improving user retention.

## Data Cleaning & Pre-processing

The raw dataset underwent several preprocessing steps to ensure accuracy and relevance:
- Handled missing values using imputation strategies.
- Conducted outlier detection and treatment.
- Transformed categorical variables into a format suitable for analysis.
- Introduced new features for enhanced insights.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Through rigorous EDA, we:
- Visualized the distribution of various user metrics.
- Detected vital patterns and trends in the data.
- Identified potential relationships between different user features.

## User Segmentation

Using clustering techniques, we segmented the users into distinct groups based on their behaviour and interaction with the platform. This segmentation aids in targeted marketing and personalized user experience enhancement.

## Predictive Modeling

A churn prediction model was developed using Logistic Regression. This model serves to identify users who are likely to stop using the service. With an accuracy of approximately 65%, this model offers a starting point for further refinements and more complex predictive algorithms.

## Conclusions

From the analysis, we derived several key insights:
- Patterns indicating which users are more likely to churn.
- Strategies that can potentially enhance user engagement and reduce churn.
- Segments of users that might benefit from targeted marketing or personalized features.
